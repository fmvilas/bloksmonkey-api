# REST API for Didgeridoo IDE

## Description
This repo is for developing the REST API. You must think to this API as the center of all common operations in Didgeridoo.

It will provide endpoints to manage user information, projects and files. All of these behind an OAuth2 protocol to maintain user information secure at the same time we provide 3rd party developers to create better plugins for the IDE.

> **IMPORTANT:** This API should not provide endpoints for creating or deleting users, though you may see some of these points available during development just for testing purposes.

## Read (and improve) the docs

There is a [docs branch](https://github.com/fmvilas/didgeridoo-api/tree/docs) in this repo where you can read further information of this API. Also feel free to open issues, create branches, create pull requests. Whatever you think it can improve this API, docs, development process, WHATEVER.
